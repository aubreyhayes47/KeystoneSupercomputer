echo "- MPI: Available for distributed parallel computing"
echo "- OpenMP: Available (OpenFOAM compiled with OpenMP support)"
echo "- Parallel workflow: decomposePar → mpirun → reconstructPar"
echo
echo "Example commands:"
echo "  Decompose:    decomposePar"
echo "  Run parallel: mpirun -np 4 <solver> -parallel"
echo "  Reconstruct:  reconstructPar"
echo
echo "For OpenMP control, set OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable"
echo
echo "Note: Full workflow test requires longer execution time."
echo "      Run OpenFOAM tutorials to test complete parallel workflow."
