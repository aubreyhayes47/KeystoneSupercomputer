# Simulation Container Orchestration Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds orchestration support to all simulation tools (OpenFOAM, LAMMPS, FEniCSx) through standardized interfaces, health checks, and status reporting APIs. These features enable robust workflow management and seamless integration with orchestration platforms like Celery, Kubernetes, and Docker Compose.

## Changes Made

### 1. Orchestration Base Class (`orchestration_base.py`)

**Location:** `src/sim-toolbox/orchestration_base.py`

Created an abstract base class that defines the standardized orchestration interface for all simulation adapters:

#### Key Features:
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health validation including:
  - Docker image availability
  - Docker daemon accessibility  
  - Output directory writability
  
- **Status Reporting**: Real-time status tracking with states:
  - IDLE, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELLED
  
- **Metadata API**: Exposes tool capabilities, version info, and configuration
  
- **Abstract Methods**: Requires adapters to implement:
  - `run_simulation()` - Main simulation execution
  - `check_image_available()` - Image availability check
  - `_get_capabilities()` - List tool capabilities
  - `_get_version()` - Get tool version

#### API Methods:
```python
adapter.health_check() -> Dict[str, Any]
adapter.get_status() -> Dict[str, Any]
adapter.get_metadata() -> Dict[str, Any]
```

### 2. Updated Adapters

All three simulation adapters have been updated to inherit from `OrchestrationBase`:

#### OpenFOAM Adapter (`openfoam/openfoam_adapter.py`)
- Inherits from `OrchestrationBase`
- Updates status during simulation execution
- Implements capability list (9 CFD features)
- Extracts OpenFOAM version from container

#### LAMMPS Adapter (`lammps/lammps_adapter.py`)
- Inherits from `OrchestrationBase`
- Updates status during simulation execution
- Implements capability list (9 MD features)
- Extracts LAMMPS version from container

#### FEniCSx Adapter (`fenicsx/fenicsx_adapter.py`)
- Inherits from `OrchestrationBase`
- Updates status during simulation execution
- Implements capability list (9 FEM features)
- Extracts FEniCSx version from container

### 3. Test Suite (`test_orchestration.py`)

**Location:** `src/sim-toolbox/test_orchestration.py`

Comprehensive test suite validating orchestration features:

#### Tests:
- Health check structure and functionality
- Status reporting structure and functionality
- Metadata API structure and functionality
- JSON serialization of all responses
- Individual checks for each adapter

#### Results:
✓ All 3 adapters pass orchestration tests
✓ All responses are JSON-serializable
✓ All required fields present in responses

### 4. Updated Integration Test (`integration_test.py`)

Enhanced the existing integration test to validate orchestration features:

#### New Validations:
- Runs health checks before simulations
- Verifies status reporting works
- Checks metadata API responses
- Confirms orchestration features don't break existing functionality

### 5. Documentation

#### Main Orchestration Guide (`ORCHESTRATION.md`)
- 11,000+ character comprehensive guide
- Health check documentation with examples
- Status reporting documentation with examples
- Metadata API documentation with examples
- Integration examples (Celery, Kubernetes, Docker Compose)
- Adapter-specific capability lists
- Best practices and troubleshooting
- Future enhancement roadmap

#### Updated Adapter Documentation (`ADAPTERS.md`)
- Added orchestration features to overview
- Documented new orchestration methods
- Added link to orchestration documentation

#### Example Script (`example_orchestration.py`)
- Demonstrates health check usage
- Shows metadata querying
- Illustrates status reporting
- Provides error handling examples
- Includes helpful troubleshooting guidance

## Testing Results

### Orchestration Test Suite
```
✓ OpenFOAM adapter - All orchestration tests passed
✓ LAMMPS adapter - All orchestration tests passed  
✓ FEniCSx adapter - All orchestration tests passed
Total: 3/3 adapters passed
```

### Adapter Validation
```
✓ FEniCSx adapter validation passed
✓ LAMMPS adapter validation passed
✓ OpenFOAM adapter validation passed
✓ API consistency validation passed
```

### Integration Test Compatibility
```
✓ Integration test imports successfully
✓ All adapters maintain backward compatibility
✓ Orchestration features integrate seamlessly
```

## API Examples

### Health Check
```python
from openfoam_adapter import OpenFOAMAdapter

adapter = OpenFOAMAdapter(output_dir="./output")
health = adapter.health_check()

if health['status'] == 'healthy':
    result = adapter.run_simulation(case_name="cavity")
else:
    print(f"Cannot run: {health['message']}")
```

### Status Monitoring
```python
status = adapter.get_status()
print(f"Current state: {status['state']}")
print(f"Last result available: {status['last_result'] is not None}")
```

### Capability Discovery
```python
metadata = adapter.get_metadata()
print(f"Tool: {metadata['tool_name']}")
print(f"Capabilities: {metadata['capabilities']}")
```

## Integration Capabilities

### Celery Integration
```python
@app.task(name='run_simulation')
def run_simulation_task(tool: str, script: str):
    adapter = get_adapter(tool)
    
    # Pre-flight check
    if adapter.health_check()['status'] != 'healthy':
        return {'error': 'Adapter unhealthy'}
    
    # Run simulation
    return adapter.run_simulation(script=script)
```

### Kubernetes Health Probes
```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  periodSeconds: 30
```

### Docker Compose Health Checks
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "python3", "-c", "...health check..."]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
```

## Backward Compatibility

All existing functionality is preserved:
- ✓ Original API methods unchanged
- ✓ Return values remain the same
- ✓ Existing tests still pass
- ✓ No breaking changes to public API

New functionality is purely additive through inheritance and new methods.

3. **Resource Metrics**: CPU, memory, and disk usage monitoring
4. **Cancellation Support**: Graceful cancellation of running simulations
5. **Remote Endpoints**: HTTP/REST API wrappers for health and status
6. **Prometheus Metrics**: Export metrics in Prometheus format
7. **OpenTelemetry**: Distributed tracing support
8. **Advanced Health Checks**: Tool-specific validation (solver availability, etc.)

✓ Adding comprehensive health checks to all adapters
✓ Implementing standardized status reporting APIs
✓ Exposing tool metadata and capabilities
