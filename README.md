# Keystone Supercomputer

Keystone Supercomputer is a personal open-source scientific computing platform designed to orchestrate simulations, automate workflows, and leverage local and cloud resources‚Äîall managed by agentic AI interfaces. This project aims to make advanced simulation, reproducibility, and intelligent automation accessible and scalable for individual researchers, engineers, and power users.

- **Tool Adapter Pattern:** Writing Python adapters for simulation tools.
- **Integration Testing:** Created comprehensive integration test validating end-to-end workflow automation across FEniCSx, LAMMPS, and OpenFOAM.

---

### **Phase 4: Orchestration & Workflows** ‚úîÔ∏è **(Completed)**
- **Docker Compose:** ‚úîÔ∏è Multi-service orchestration with `docker-compose.yml` - see [DOCKER_COMPOSE.md](DOCKER_COMPOSE.md).
- **Job Queue:** ‚úîÔ∏è Celery + Redis integration for background task processing with worker service.
- **Local Kubernetes:** Setup with `k3d`, `kubectl`, and `helm` (pending).

---

### **Phase 5: Performance Optimization** üîú **(Upcoming)**
- **Hardware Acceleration:** GPU/NPU access in containers.
- **Parallelism:** OpenMP/MPI configuration.

---

### **Phase 6: Multi-Agent System** üîú **(Upcoming)**

## CLI - Workflow Submission and Monitoring

The Keystone Supercomputer CLI provides comprehensive commands for workflow submission and job monitoring. See [CLI_REFERENCE.md](CLI_REFERENCE.md) for complete documentation.

### Quick Start

```bash
cd src/agent

# Check worker health
python3 cli.py health

# List available simulation tools
python3 cli.py list-tools

# Submit a simulation task
python3 cli.py submit fenicsx poisson.py -p '{"mesh_size": 64}' --wait

# Submit a workflow
python3 cli.py submit-workflow ../../example_workflow.json --parallel --wait

# Check task status
python3 cli.py status <task-id> --monitor
```

### Available Commands

- `health` - Check Celery worker health
- `list-tools` - List available simulation tools
- `submit` - Submit a single simulation task
- `status` - Check task status and monitor progress
- `cancel` - Cancel a running task
- `submit-workflow` - Submit multiple tasks as a workflow
- `workflow-status` - Check status of workflow tasks
- `ask` - Interact with LLM agent

---

## Docker Compose Orchestration

The project includes a comprehensive Docker Compose setup for multi-service orchestration. See [DOCKER_COMPOSE.md](DOCKER_COMPOSE.md) for full documentation.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run the quick start script
./docker-compose-quickstart.sh

# Build simulation images
docker compose build

# Run a test simulation
docker compose run --rm fenicsx poisson.py

# Start Redis and Celery worker
docker compose up -d redis celery-worker

# Stop all services
docker compose down
```

### Available Services

- **Redis** - Message broker for job queuing
- **Celery Worker** - Background job processing
- **FEniCSx** - Finite Element Method simulations
- **LAMMPS** - Molecular Dynamics simulations
- **OpenFOAM** - Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations

### Job Queue Management

The Celery worker provides asynchronous job execution. Use the Task Pipeline module for a high-level, agent-friendly interface:

```python
from task_pipeline import TaskPipeline

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = TaskPipeline()

# Submit and monitor a simulation task
task_id = pipeline.submit_task(
    tool="fenicsx",
    script="poisson.py",
    params={"mesh_size": 64}
)

# Wait for completion
result = pipeline.wait_for_task(task_id, timeout=300)
```

See [TASK_PIPELINE.md](TASK_PIPELINE.md) for comprehensive documentation and examples.

For direct Celery usage, see [CELERY_QUICK_REFERENCE.md](CELERY_QUICK_REFERENCE.md).
