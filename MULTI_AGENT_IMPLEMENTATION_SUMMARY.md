# Multi-Agent System Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the LangGraph-based Conductor-Performer pattern for multi-agent simulation orchestration in Keystone Supercomputer.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Graph Implementation (`conductor_performer_graph.py`)

**Key Components:**
- **ConductorAgent**: Central orchestrator with 4 main methods
  - `analyze_request()`: Parse user requests and create execution plans
  - `delegate_tasks()`: Assign tasks to appropriate Performers
  - `aggregate_results()`: Combine results from multiple Performers
  - `handle_error()`: Implement retry logic and refinement

- **PerformerAgent**: Base class for domain-specific simulation agents
  - FEniCSx Performer: Finite Element Method simulations
  - LAMMPS Performer: Molecular Dynamics simulations
  - OpenFOAM Performer: Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations
  - `execute_task()`: Execute simulations using specialized tools

- **ValidatorAgent**: Quality control and feedback generation
  - `validate_results()`: Check task completion and result quality
  - Generate feedback for refinement iterations

- **ConductorPerformerGraph**: LangGraph workflow orchestrator
  - 8 graph nodes (analyze, delegate, 3 performers, validate, aggregate, handle_error)
  - Sequential execution edges for ordered workflows
  - Conditional edges for decision points (validation, error handling)
  - Feedback loop for iterative refinement (max 3 iterations by default)

**State Management:**
- Comprehensive state schema tracking:
  - Messages and conversation history
  - Execution plans and delegated tasks
  - Performer results and validation feedback
  - Errors and iteration count
  - Final aggregated results

**Example Workflows:**
- Structural Analysis (single tool)
- Multi-Physics Coupled Simulation (multiple tools)
- Parameter Sweep (parallel configurations)
- Error Recovery (automatic refinement)

## Technical Specifications

### LangGraph Integration

**Graph Structure:**
```
StateGraph(ConductorPerformerState)
├── Entry: analyze
├── Nodes: 8 (analyze, delegate, 3x execute, validate, aggregate, handle_error)
├── Edges: 6 sequential + 2 conditional
└── Exit: END (from aggregate or handle_error)
```

**State Schema:**
- TypedDict with 11 fields
- Annotated messages list with operator.add reducer
- NotRequired fields for optional state
- Enum types for status and roles

**Edge Routing:**
1. **Sequential**: analyze → delegate → execute → validate
2. **Conditional #1**: validate → {aggregate | handle_error}
3. **Conditional #2**: handle_error → {delegate | END}

### Integration Points

**Existing Infrastructure:**
- TaskPipeline: Performers use existing task submission API
- Celery Backend: Tasks executed through worker pool
- Job Monitoring: Results tracked in job history
- Resource Profiling: Metrics collected per task

**Extensibility:**
- Easy to add new Performer agents (just inherit from PerformerAgent)
- Configurable max iterations and refinement strategies
- Pluggable validation logic
- Custom workflow definitions
