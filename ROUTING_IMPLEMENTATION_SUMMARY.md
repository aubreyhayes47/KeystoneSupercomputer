# Workflow Routing Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds comprehensive routing logic and conditional edges for LangGraph workflow execution in Keystone Supercomputer. It provides intelligent decision-making capabilities based on agent outputs, error states, workflow context, and resource availability.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Routing Engine (`workflow_routing.py`)

**Size**: ~900 lines of production code

**Key Components**:
- `WorkflowRouter` class with 8 routing strategies
- `RoutingDecision` dataclass for decision encapsulation
- `ExecutionMetrics` for performance tracking
- State schema (`WorkflowRoutingState`) for routing decisions
- Pre-built routing functions for common patterns

**Routing Strategies**:
1. ✅ Success Path - Normal workflow progression
2. ✅ Error Fallback - Graceful degradation with severity levels
3. ✅ Retry with Backoff - Exponential backoff (2^n) for transient failures
4. ✅ Conditional Branch - Output value and context-based routing
5. ✅ Resource-Aware - CPU/memory/GPU availability-based routing
6. ✅ Performance-Based - Historical metrics-based adaptive routing
7. ✅ Parallel Execution - Fan-out/fan-in with join nodes
8. ✅ Circuit Breaker - Fault tolerance pattern

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Routing
```python
from workflow_routing import WorkflowRouter, WorkflowRoutingState, NodeStatus

router = WorkflowRouter()
state: WorkflowRoutingState = {
    "node_status": {"task": NodeStatus.COMPLETED},
    "node_results": {},
    "retry_count": 0
}

decision = router.route_after_execution(
    state=state,
    current_node="task",
    success_node="next",
    error_node="error"
)
# Result: Routes to "next"
```

### Example 2: Context-Based Routing
```python
state: WorkflowRoutingState = {
    "workflow_context": {"priority": "high"}
}

routing_rules = [
    {"condition": lambda p: p == "high", "node": "fast_path", "reason": "High priority"}
]

decision = router.route_by_context(
    state=state,
    context_key="priority",
    routing_rules=routing_rules,
    default_node="standard"
)
# Result: Routes to "fast_path"
```

### Example 3: LangGraph Integration
```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from workflow_routing import route_by_validation_result

workflow = StateGraph(WorkflowRoutingState)
workflow.add_node("validate", validate_fn)
workflow.add_node("aggregate", aggregate_fn)
workflow.add_node("error", error_fn)

workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "validate",
    route_by_validation_result,
    {
        "aggregate": "aggregate",
        "refine": "plan",
        "error": "error"
    }
)
```

## Key Features

### Decision-Making Criteria

**Based On**:
- ✅ Agent execution results (success/failure)
- ✅ Error states with severity levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- ✅ Workflow context (priority, preferences)
- ✅ Resource availability (CPU, memory, GPU)
- ✅ Historical performance metrics
- ✅ Circuit breaker state
- ✅ Retry count and limits

### Fault Tolerance

**Mechanisms**:
- Exponential backoff for retries (2^0, 2^1, 2^2... seconds)
- Circuit breaker pattern (configurable threshold)
- Graceful degradation with fallback paths
- Error severity classification
- Maximum retry limits

### Observability

**Tracking**:
- Routing decision history
- Performance metrics per node
- Success rates and execution times
- Circuit breaker state
- Retry attempts and backoff times
